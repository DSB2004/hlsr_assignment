###  Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery
AI can significantly increase front-end development, particularly for applications with repetitive functionality such as admin dashboards or CRUD-heavy systems. By automating certain aspects of the development process, AI enhances productivity and reduces the time-to-market. In fast-paced startup environments, this advantage is even more impactful—enabling teams to build features with greater efficiency and ship more functionality in shorter timeframes.



### Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students

In this domain, AI can power features that enhance classroom management and student productivity. For example, an AI-driven class manager could help students organise their schedules, track assignments, and receive smart reminders. Similarly, a collaborative to-do list feature could allow teachers to assign tasks to specific students while ensuring that students only see and manage their own responsibilities. Such AI-assisted tools not only streamline class organisation but also foster accountability and efficiency in day-to-day learning.
